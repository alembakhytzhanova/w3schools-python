#Python Lists

"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets
"""
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)


"""
List Items
List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

"""


#Ordered
#When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

#If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.


"""
Changeable
The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.
"""

#Allow Duplicates
#Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

#List Length
#To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

#List Items - Data Types
#List items can be of any data type:
list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]

#A list can contain different data types:   
list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]   


#type()
#From Python's perspective, lists are defined as objects with the data type 'list':

#<class 'list'>

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(mylist))

#The list() Constructor
#It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creating a new list.

thislist = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thislist)




#Python Collections (Arrays)
#There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

#List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.
