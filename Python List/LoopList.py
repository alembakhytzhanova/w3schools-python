#Loop Through a List
#You can loop through the list items by using a for loop
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)

#Loop Through the Index Numbers
#You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print("range and len", thislist[i])

  

#Using a While Loop
#You can loop through the list items by using a while loop.

#Use the len() function to determine the length of the list, then start at 0 and loop your way through the list items by referring to their indexes.

#Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print("while loop", thislist[i])
  i = i + 1



#Looping Using List Comprehension
#List Comprehension offers the shortest syntax for looping through lists

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
