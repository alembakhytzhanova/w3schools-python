"""
Strings
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.

'hello' is the same as "hello".

You can display a string literal with the print() function:
"""
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

#Quotes Inside Quotes
#You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

#Assign String to a Variable
#Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
a = "Hello"
print(a)

#Multiline Strings
#You can assign a multiline string to a variable by using three quotes:
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."""
print(a)

#Or three single quotes:

a = '''Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.'''
print(a)
